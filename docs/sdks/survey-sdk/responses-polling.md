# Responses Polling

Engage Digital will poll your survey responses by performing a `GET /responses` on your bridge every 15 minutes along with a `since` parameter corresponding to the the most recent response fetched's `submitted_at` field.

This parameter will be sent as milliseconds in UTC time (e.g. if **base URL of the bridge** is `https://survey.bridge.com` and your most recent response was submitted on `2022-01-10T10:00:00.000Z` then Engage Digital will perform a `GET https://survey.bridge.com/responses?since=1641808800000`).

## Response example

Here's an example of a valid response to the responses polling:
```json
{
  "id": "12345",
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "12345_response_1",
      "submitted_at": "2022-01-10T10:00:00.000Z",
      "mapping_key": "response_mapping_key",
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "main_question",
          "replies": [
            {
              "value": "5"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": "multiple_choices_question",
          "replies": [
            {
              "value": "Faster response time"
            },
            {
              "value": "Better follow-up"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": "free_text_question",
          "replies": [
            {
              "value": "Everything's already perfect"
            }
          ]
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Response mapping key

When sending the link to take a survey, Engage Digital will add an additional `i` parameter in the URL to bind the response with the conversation:

!!! warning
    Please note that the response will be ignored by Engage Digital if the `mapping_key` parameter is not present or if it cannot be matched with an existing conversation.
