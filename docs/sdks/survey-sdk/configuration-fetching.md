# Configuration Fetching

When creating a Survey SDK in Engage Digital you need to specify the **base URL of the bridge** field (see [Getting Started](../quick-start)) which will be used to perform an HTTP request to fetch the survey configuration.

Upon survey creation, Engage Digital will perform a `GET /configuration` call on your bridge to fetch the survey configuration (e.g. if **base URL of the bridge** is `https://survey.bridge.com` then Engage Digital will perform a `GET https://survey.bridge.com/configuration`).

## Response example

Here's an example of a valid Survey SDK configuration:
``` json
{
  "id": "12345",
  "link": "https://link.tothesurvey.com",
  "status": "Opened",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "main_question",
      "text": "Are you satisfied with our customer service?",
      "main": true,
      "choices": [
        {
          "text": "Very satisfied",
          "value": "5"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "multiple_choices_question",
      "text": "What can we do to improve our service?",
      "main": false,
      "choices": [
        {
          "text": "Faster response time"
        },
        {
          "text": "Better follow-up"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "free_text_question",
      "text": "Any other suggestion?",
      "main": false,
      "choices": []
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
